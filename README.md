# Quote-Maker
QuoteMaker With Tweet Style 

This is a Python script that allows the user to create custom quotes by selecting a background image, font, text color, and entering up to 10 lines of text. The script uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to manipulate the image and draw the text onto it. Once the quote is created, the user can save it as a new image file. The script also has a feature to allow the user to create multiple quotes in one session.
